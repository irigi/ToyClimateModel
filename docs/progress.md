# Progress log

Format per SPEC.md §10.6. Newest entry at the bottom.

## Status

| Milestone | State |
|---|---|
| M0 Skeleton | done (CI to be confirmed on first push) |
| M1 Spectral transforms | Gaussian quadrature (test 1) done; rest not started |
| M2–M6 | not started |

## Versions

- Rust 1.97.0 (cloud session), edition 2021.
- `godot` crate 0.5.5 with feature `api-4-5` (runs on Godot ≥ 4.5). Godot binary not yet
  installed or tested (M3).

## Dependencies beyond the SPEC.md §2 allow-list

None.

## 2026-11-04 — M0 skeleton

**Done**

- Cargo workspace with `toyclim-core`, `toyclim-headless` (binary `toyclim`) and
  `toyclim-godot` (cdylib, stub `ClimateModel` node; the only `unsafe` is gdext's
  required `unsafe impl ExtensionLibrary`). Core and headless use `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- `Real` alias with `f32` feature; model time is always `f64` seconds (`Seconds`) so long
  runs keep clock accuracy in f32 builds.
- `config.rs`: TOML config with duration strings (`"30min"`, `"1day"`, `"2.4h"`, `"1e3s"`,
  bare numbers = seconds), planet preset + overrides (`rotation_factor` as an alternative
  to `rotation_rate`), diffusion and RAW-filter blocks with SPEC defaults,
  `deny_unknown_fields` so typos fail loudly. The SPEC §6 example parses in a unit test.
- `io/npy.rs`: .npy v1.0 writer/reader (`<f4`, `<f8`, C order) with round-trip and
  dtype-mismatch tests. `io/meta.rs`: `meta.json` writer (grid, σ, planet, config echo,
  git hash embedded at build time by `build.rs`).
- `spectral/gauss.rs` + `grid.rs`: Gaussian latitudes/weights (Newton from Tricomi
  guesses), grid sizes from the §4.1 table (with a fallback rule for other T), global
  integral. This already covers M1 test 1.
- `toyclim run` (dummy model: f = sin φ + cos²φ cos 3(λ − Ωt)), `toyclim list-cases`;
  `toyclim bench` is a stub until M2.
- `tools/plot_field.py` (map / polar / zonal), `tools/requirements.txt`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, a smoke run and a plot.
- Godot project skeleton (`godot/`, `toyclim.gdextension`) and `run` script.

**Measured**

- Σ w_j − 2 < 1e-14 for N_lat ∈ {1, 2, 3, 32, …, 256}; μ^n integrated to < 1e-13 for
  n ≤ 2N_lat − 1, N_lat ∈ {32, 64, 128, 256}.
- Sphere area via the grid integral at T42: relative error < 1e-14.
- `cargo test --workspace`: 13 tests pass (12 core unit, 1 headless end-to-end).
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check`: clean.
- `cargo build -p toyclim-core --features f32`: builds.

**Open questions**: see below.

**Next step**: M1 — Legendre functions (§4.2), packing, FFT wrapper, transforms and
operators, tests 2–6, criterion benchmarks.

## Open questions for the owner

1. ~~License~~ — resolved: MIT (LICENSE added).
2. Owner scoping answers are in `docs/design-decisions.md`. Two of them extend the SPEC and
   need a go-ahead before implementation: station time-series output (proposed for M2,
   SPEC §6 addition) and a procedural terrain milestone (after M9).
